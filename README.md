# odin-recipes
This project is a hands-on practice assignment designed by the developers at The Odin Project. This project will allow me to test my html developing knowledge.

Recap:
When doing this project I created a recipe page with three recipes on it. I created links to each of these seperate pages, and developed each one to have a picture, description, unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps. I also became more familiar with git while working on this project.
